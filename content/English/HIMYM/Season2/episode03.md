Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?

Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward.

It's kind of revealing.

I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so my calves have really been cramping up.

To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses.

Way to wreck the curve, kiss ass.

The woman's basically a ride at a water park.

No, it wasn't a snap decision

You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that.

Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down-to-earth.
