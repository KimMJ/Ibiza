Hey, cut her some slack.

Do you know why you're not over Lily yet?

I think he's beyond repair.

Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually till your periods sync up?

That's really the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.

You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall, and frankly,
a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.

But if you go down there right now like this,
you're going to blow it for him, and he's never going to forgive you.

Bold. Bold to go for the car.

So you're a gun nut?

I was so freaked out, and I got up to my room, and there was my roommate,
lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall

It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes..
